# Data Cleaning with Pandas: Transforming Messy Data into Insights

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning workflow using **Python** and the **Pandas** library. Working with a messy or randomly collected dataset, the goal is to showcase essential data wrangling techniques to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

---

## Overview

Real-world datasets are often messy, incomplete, or inconsistent. This project focuses on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset
- Handling missing, duplicate, and incorrect values
- Renaming, restructuring, and formatting data
- Exporting the clean dataset for future use

The project is written in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.

##  Dataset

A sample messy dataset is used, which may include:
- Null/missing values
- Inconsistent column names
- Mixed data types
- Irrelevant or noisy rows

You can easily replace it with any dataset of your choice to practice the cleaning techniques.
